Week 1 Movie App

## Flix Part 1

### User Stories
User Stories - What will our app do?
A user story simply describes the stuff we want a user of our app to be able to do. We'll break up each project into required and bonus user stories. Once we've listed out what our app should do, we can create a plan of attack.

#### Required User Stories (10 pts)
- [x] User sees an app icon on the home screen and a styled launch screen.
- [x] User can view and scroll through a list of movies now playing in theaters.
- [x] User can view the movie posters in each row.

#### Bonus User Stories
- [] User can view the app on various device sizes and orientations.
- [x] Run your app on a real device (gif is run on real device and loaded below).

### Notes
During this project, I had the most challenge with installing Alamofire and OAuthSwift pods. 
In my app, I also removed the colored background for poster images, but it didn't remove itself in the preview on the device.
After using a physical device to preview the app, I also noticed that XCode no longer showed a computer preview for a generated device.
