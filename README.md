### Notes
- During this project, I had the most challenge with installing Alamofire and OAuthSwift pods. 
- In my app, I also removed the colored background for poster images, but it didn't remove itself in the preview on the device.
- After using a physical device to preview the app, I also noticed that XCode no longer showed a computer preview for a generated device. 
- I also tried the bonus and noticed much of the menu for constraints had changed. XCode gave me a few suggestions for the constraints and I followed the instructions as much as I could, making sure to include automatic row height instead of the hard coded value. See image below:
